# Data-Analysis-on-Coronavirus
In this project, my primary objective was to perform data analysis on the COVID-19 dataset by leveraging various Python libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The dataset used contains crucial information, such as the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported on a daily basis, alongside diverse life factors scored by individuals residing in different countries worldwide.
The first step involved preprocessing the COVID-19 dataset, which included handling missing values, data cleaning, and converting data types if required. This process aimed to ensure the dataset's reliability and consistency, creating a solid foundation for subsequent analyses.
Next, the life factors dataset was merged with the COVID-19 dataset using relevant country identifiers. This merging operation allowed the combination of the two datasets into a unified and comprehensive dataset, enabling meaningful correlations and insights between the COVID-19 cases and the various life factors.
Once the datasets were merged, essential measures were calculated from the combined data. These measures might include identifying the worst-hit countries in terms of cumulative COVID-19 cases, determining trends in infection rates over time, and analyzing the impact of life factors on the spread of the virus.
To achieve these goals, Numpy was employed for numerical computations and statistical operations, while Pandas facilitated data manipulation, aggregation, and filtering. Seaborn and Matplotlib were then utilized to generate informative visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots. These visual representations aided in better understanding patterns and relationships between COVID-19 cases and the various life factors, making complex information more accessible and interpretable.
Overall, the project showcases a comprehensive data analysis pipeline, starting from preprocessing and merging datasets to calculating relevant measures and ultimately generating insights through visualizations. This holistic approach allows researchers, policymakers, and the general public to gain valuable insights into the impact of COVID-19 and its correlations with life factors, aiding in informed decision-making and potential strategies for tackling the pandemic.
